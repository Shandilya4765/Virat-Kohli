            Autobiography of Virat Kohli
        </h1>       
        <br><br>
        <h4>
            <p>Virat Kohli, one of India's most celebrated cricketers, was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, was a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, was a homemaker. Kohli has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna. He spent his early years in Uttam Nagar, where he began his education at Vishal Bharti Public School. His natural inclination toward cricket became evident at the age of three when he started playing with a bat and asking his father to bowl to him.

                In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was established, and Kohli's father enrolled him under the guidance of Rajkumar Sharma. This decision was influenced by neighbors who recognized Kohli's potential and suggested formal training beyond street cricket. Despite his talent, Kohli initially struggled to make the under-14 Delhi team, reportedly due to external factors. Offers to join influential clubs that could secure his selection were declined by his father. Kohli eventually broke through and was selected for the under-15 Delhi team. Alongside his training at the WDCA, he played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy in Vasundhara Enclave and shifted to Saviour Convent School during ninth grade to further his cricket career.
                
                Tragedy struck on 18 December 2006, when Kohli's father passed away following a cerebral attack. His mother noted that this loss profoundly impacted him, making him more focused and determined in his cricketing pursuits. Kohli's family lived in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar, until 2015, after which they moved to Gurgaon.</p>

            Career
        </h1>
        <h4>
            <p>
               <b> 2008–2009: Debut and Early Journey</b>
             In August 2008, Virat Kohli earned a surprise call-up to the Indian ODI squad for the Sri Lanka tour and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan, despite having played only eight List A matches. During the Sri Lanka series, injuries to first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag saw Kohli stepping in as a makeshift opener. On August 18, 2008, at the age of 19, Kohli made his international debut in the first ODI, scoring 12 runs before being dismissed by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara. However, he showcased his potential in the fourth match by scoring his maiden ODI half-century, contributing 54 runs.

After the Champions Trophy was postponed to 2009, Kohli joined the India A squad in September 2008 as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan for the unofficial Tests against Australia A. In his lone innings, he scored 49 runs, making an impression despite limited opportunities. In October, Kohli played a four-day tour match against Australia for the Indian Board President's XI, where he impressed with a commanding 105 in the first innings against a formidable bowling attack featuring Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson, and others.

In November 2008, Kohli was included in the ODI squad for the home series against England but did not get a chance to play. In December, he was awarded a Grade D contract by the BCCI, earning ₹1.5 million annually (equivalent to ₹4.2 million in 2023). Despite this, he was dropped for the January 2009 ODI series against Sri Lanka.

Kohli's breakthrough came during the Emerging Players Tournament in Australia in July–August 2009. Opening the innings for the Indian Emerging Players team, he finished as the tournament’s leading scorer with 398 runs at an average of 66.33. His standout performance came in the final against South Africa Emerging Players, where he scored 104 runs off 102 balls, leading his team to a 17-run victory and the title. Kohli later described this tournament as a "turning point" in his career, with his performances earning praise from Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of the Indian selection committee.

In August 2009, Kohli returned to the Indian team, replacing an injured Gautam Gambhir for the tri-series in Sri Lanka. He was later utilized as a middle-order batsman in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy due to Yuvraj Singh’s injury.

By December 2009, Kohli was back in the squad for the home ODI series against Sri Lanka. He scored 27 and 54 in the first two matches before being replaced by Yuvraj, who had regained fitness. However, Yuvraj’s recurring finger injury opened the door for Kohli in the fourth ODI in Kolkata. In that match, Kohli scored his maiden ODI century, a brilliant 107 off 114 balls, sharing a 224-run partnership with Gambhir. His efforts helped India secure a seven-wicket victory and clinch the series 3–1.

            Playing Style
        </h1>
        <h4>
           <p>
            Virat Kohli is known for his exceptional technical skills and dynamic approach to batting. His preferred position in ODI cricket is at number three, where he adopts a slightly open-chested stance and grips the bottom handle of his bat firmly. Kohli’s batting is characterized by agile footwork, a wide range of strokes, and the ability to build innings effectively, especially under pressure. He emphasizes playing grounded shots over big hits, showcasing mastery in wrist shots and consistent precision in the mid-wicket and cover regions.

One of Kohli’s signature shots is the cover drive, a stroke he considers his favorite. He also frequently employs the flick shot, particularly against deliveries aimed at the leg stump. While Kohli rarely uses the sweep shot, his ground-oriented technique allows him to accumulate runs between deep square leg and mid-on. His bat speed and supple wrist movements enable him to create unique angles, often unsettling traditional field placements. Additionally, Kohli is a skilled fielder, contributing significantly to his team's overall performance.

However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries wide of the off-stump, a weakness bowlers often exploit in Tests and ODIs. Cricket experts, including VVS Laxman, Sanjay Manjrekar, and Richard Hadlee, have highlighted his susceptibility to out-swinging deliveries. Despite this, Kohli has established himself as a dominant limited-overs batsman.

In ODIs, Kohli averages 65.5 runs while batting second and 51.7 when batting first. He has scored 27 of his 50 ODI centuries in run-chases, holding the record for the most hundreds while batting second. Kohli thrives under the pressure of chasing targets, enjoying the challenge of rotating strike efficiently and executing boundary shots when required. His dedication, focus, and work ethic are widely admired by teammates and opponents alike.

            Aggression
        </h1>
        <h4>
            <p>
                Kohli’s playing style and leadership are marked by aggression and intensity. As a captain, he is proactive and leads by example, often making bold decisions on the field. While his assertiveness and confidence have drawn praise, his aggressive demeanor has also sparked criticism, particularly during the early stages of his career when he was perceived as brash and arrogant.

                Over time, Kohli has worked to temper his behavior but acknowledges that high-pressure situations sometimes test his composure. Despite this, he views his aggression as a driving force, fueling his motivation and focus on the field.
                
                Huw Richards, writing for The New York Times, observed that Kohli’s assertiveness contrasts with the perceived politeness and reticence of some former Indian cricketers. Kohli embodies a combative spirit, both on and off the field, which has become a defining aspect of his persona and success as a cricketer.
